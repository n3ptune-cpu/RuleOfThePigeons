# Rule of the Pigeons
This is a Unity game I was assigned to create for college. It's a basic 2D platformer where you must save all the birds (pigeons) and destroy the falcons who have terrorized their forest.
The game isn't perfect, as I had assistance from ChatGPT with the code (since I’m not a programmer), but if you would like to see the source, game resources, and files, they are available in this repository.

This game was created using Unity Editor 2022.34f1, which was the version of the editor installed on the college’s system.

You can either build the game yourself and make your own modifications, or try it out with the pre-compiled version in the releases tab.
Since I’m not a programmer, I received assistance from ChatGPT for the code (which was allowed for the assignment).

## What does this assignment require?
The assignment I was provided required me to include the following features:

- A fully functional 2D platformer
- Collectables (the pigeons to be saved)
- Enemies (the falcons who patrol the scene)
- 2 different levels (the two scenes in this game)
- A countdown timer, lives counter, and UI to show what you've saved
- Powerups
- The ability to complete and progress through the game
  
It’s a pretty basic concept, right? Well, yes, but most people in my class, including me, are not experts in programming or using Unity, so this is my first attempt at creating a 2D game. Please don’t judge me too harshly!
